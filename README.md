# BilliardBall
A billiard ball game written in java. This is inspired by the game I played when i was in high school.
I was curious about the ball trajectories as the momentum equation can only solve the collision of two balls.
After i learning the partial form of the momentum equation and angular momentum equation, the mechanism came
into my head. Afterwards, i program this game to dispell my doubts.
Furthermore, i shared this program for the guys who also have the same doubts.
